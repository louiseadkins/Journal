      <div class="entry">

      <p>I had intended to do a week one entry, but i had to de-prioritize it when i realized i was more behind than i thought on the out-of-class  work, partly due to my days off the week before-hand being somewhat hijacked by a family emergency (my grandpa w/ late-stage Alzheimer's got basically a blood clot in his brain, he's going to be okay, relatively speaking), plus my timing in ordering the Duckett textbooks was very bad and they didn't arrive until monday afternoon. (i really should've just ordered them in the first place, but OH WELL)
<br>
 I've gone through the javascript basics treehouse (again, i wasn't able to finish it before primer pro began)- admittedly i skipped some parts of it like the challenges, mostly watching the video parts. and i also dipped into the javascript loops arrays and objects course.
<br>
aaaaaand I'm encountering very significant difficulting with learning javascript so far. <br>
In fact I think this gif gives a pretty accurate representation of my relationship with javascript right now.<p>

<p>
i've done the first step of the assignment, and then i've (done my best to) read through the code/instructions. and (though i'm not 100% sure if they're correct) i've answered, i think at this stage, most of the questions. but i haven't been able to get any farther than that in the project.
<br>
i feel like nothing's sticking, and it's very frustrating and discouraging. i know that i've really only just started learning it , and i shouldn't be hard on myself just because i don't quickly pick up on something new, BUT at the same time, i would really like to be able to keep up with the class.
<br>
so i'm pretty nervous about next class. i'm sure i'm not the only person who's struggling, but i still feel pretty crummy about it. (Sorry for the lazy formatting/capitalization.)
